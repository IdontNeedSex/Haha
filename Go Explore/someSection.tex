\section{Some Section Capitalized as Usual}\label{sec:FirstSection}

This is a dummy reference to refer to Sec.~\ref{sec:FirstSection}.

% I recommend to put the following into a comment rather than
% deleting it so that you can check how to cite correctly.
This is how you should cite publications: Back-up the statement of a whole sentence by putting the reference at the end of it as it's done here \citep{Helmert08HowGoodIsPerfect}. Sometimes, one message can be backed up by two referenes at the same time \citep{Erol96ComplexityResultsForHTN,RussellNorvig2016AIMA}. Finally, sometimes you want to mention the authors' name. For instance, you might want to mention that the book by \cite{RussellNorvig2016AIMA} is the fourth-most cited book in this century. In case you need to mention the authors -- like \citeauthor{RussellNorvig2016AIMA} -- several times and very close to each other, it seems strange to add the year of the publication to the names again, so use the respective commands accordingly. Check the source code of this paragraph for the citation commands.
