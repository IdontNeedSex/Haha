\section{Section Number Two is the Second Section}\label{sec:SecondSection}

This is yet another dummy reference -- this time referencing Sec.~\ref{sec:SecondSection}. One \LaTeX{} hint: Please note that with the tilde sign you can prevent a line break between the two involved words. This is usually done before section numbers as in the beginning of this paragraph as it usually does not look nice if a new line starts with a number.
